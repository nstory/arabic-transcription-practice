# Arabic Transcription Practice
https://nstory.github.io/arabic-transcription-practice/

This is a quick tool for me to practice reading Arabic script. It shows a word in Arabic script, and you are prompted to transcribe it into the Latin alphabet.

All the words, transcriptions, and audio files are from the excellent [arabic.fi](https://arabic.fi/).

## Getting Started
The Node.js version is specified in `.nvmrc` which is respected by [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
